# Revised_Huang_Model
This project contains a revised static model, which is the Huang's model, of describing calcium-based neuromodulation induced by TBS.

## Folder Summary
1. ExperimentalMeasurements: this folder contains all experimental data used to re-calibrate the revised model. These experimental data are digitalized from plots in articles:
